##                              URL Shortner


Usually small third party websites have long urls which it takes up more space than the actual message we want to share. So we can use a URL Shortner to shorten the url and make it more readable.


## Access

Inorder to access the app you have to sign up and verify your account in *[URL Shortner](https://urlshortner7.netlify.app/)*

After verifying your account, you can create short urls and share them with your friends by logging into your account.

You can also see the number of short urls and the long urls corresponding to the short urls in your dashboard.



## Features

Each and every time you create a short url you can see the number of short urls and the long urls in the table updating accordingly.

This is done by calling the ***getcreatedurls api*** whenever you create a short url and passing it to the table component.


## UI

### TAILWIND CSS 

I have used tailwind css for the UI of the app but I didn't make it responsive. In my next website I will make it responsive and more appealing UI
